# Coding_Quiz_Challenge

## Description

Coding quiz, for job seekers, launches on a start page. When the user clicks on start quiz, a timer is initiated to start at 75 seconds. An array object is displayed with a question, an array of potential answers, and an array choice for an answer. The correct answer is stored in the object. If the answer is incorrect 15 seconds is deducted from the applicants score. Once the answer is submitted, the application iterates to the next question, until the end of the list of questions. At the completion of the quiz the user is prompted to enter initials of their name to submit the score obtained. The score is saved to local storage. The quiz can be attempted multiple times and the new scores will be saved to local storage. On the home page or the completion of a quiz, the user can view the high scores, which retrieves the data from local storage. Additionally, the applicant can clear all scores from local storage on the high scores page.
